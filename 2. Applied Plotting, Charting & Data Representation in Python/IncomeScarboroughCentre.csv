Income taxes refers to the sum of federal income taxes  provincial and territorial income taxes  less abatement where applicable. Provincial and territorial income taxes include health care premiums in certain jurisdictions. Abatement reduces the federal income taxes payable by persons residing in Quebec or in certain self-governing Yukon First Nation settlement lands.
,For the 2016 Census  the reference period is the calendar year 2015 for all income variables.
,Average income - Average income of a specified group is calculated by dividing the aggregate income of that group by the number of units in that group. Average incomes of persons not in families are calculated for all units  whether or not they had income.
41, Calculation includes persons not in economic families without income (with an income of zero).
42, Economic family after-tax income decile group - The economic family income decile group provides a rough ranking of the economic situation of a person based on his or her relative position in the Canadian distribution of the adjusted after-tax income of economic families for all persons in private households.
,Using data from the 2016 Census of Population  the population in private households is sorted according to its adjusted after-tax family income and then divided into 10 equal groups each containing 10% of the population. The decile cut-points are the levels of adjusted after-tax family income that define the 10 groups.
,For the 2016 Census  the reference period is the calendar year 2015 for all income variables.
43, Low-income status - The income situation of the statistical unit in relation to a specific low-income line in a reference year. Statistical units with income that is below the low-income line are considered to be in low income.
,For the 2016 Census  the reference period is the calendar year 2015 for all income variables.
,The low-income concepts are not applied in the territories and in certain areas based on census subdivision type (such as Indian reserves). The existence of substantial in-kind transfers (such as subsidized housing and First Nations band housing) and sizeable barter economies or consumption from own production (such as product from hunting  farming or fishing) could make the interpretation of low-income statistics more difficult in these situations.
,Low-income measure  after tax (LIM-AT) - The Low-income measure  after tax  refers to a fixed percentage (50%) of median-adjusted after-tax income of private households. The household after-tax income is adjusted by an equivalence scale to take economies of scale into account. This adjustment for different household sizes reflects the fact that a household's needs increase  but at a decreasing rate  as the number of members increases.
,Using data from the 2016 Census of Population  the line applicable to a household is defined as half the Canadian median of the adjusted household after-tax income multiplied by the square root of household size. The median is determined based on all persons in private households where low-income concepts are applicable. Thresholds for specific household sizes are presented in Table 4.2 Low-income measures thresholds (LIM-AT and LIM-BT) for private households of Canada  2015  Dictionary  Census of Population  2016.
,When the unadjusted after-tax income of household pertaining to a person falls below the threshold applicable to the person based on household size  the person is considered to be in low income according to LIM-AT. Since the LIM-AT threshold and household income are unique within each household  low-income status based on LIM-AT can also be reported for households.
,Low-income cut-offs  after tax (LICO-AT) - The Low-income cut-offs  after tax refers to an income threshold  defined using 1992 expenditure data  below which economic families or persons not in economic families would likely have devoted a larger share of their after-tax income than average to the necessities of food  shelter and clothing. More specifically  the thresholds represented income levels at which these families or persons were expected to spend 20 percentage points or more of their after-tax income than average on food  shelter and clothing. These thresholds have been adjusted to current dollars using the all-items Consumer Price Index (CPI).
,The LICO-AT has 35 cut-offs varying by seven family sizes and five different sizes of area of residence to account for economies of scale and potential differences in cost of living in communities of different sizes. These thresholds are presented in Table 4.3 Low-income cut-offs  after tax (LICO-AT - 1992 base) for economic families and persons not in economic families  2015  Dictionary  Census of Population  2016.
,When the after-tax income of an economic family member or a person not in an economic family falls below the threshold applicable to the person  the person is considered to be in low income according to LICO-AT. Since the LICO-AT threshold and family income are unique within each economic family  low-income status based on LICO-AT can also be reported for economic families.
,Prevalence of low income - The proportion or percentage of units whose income falls below a specified low-income line.
